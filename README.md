## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before diving into Aurora Gold, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
- Google Gemini API key (with token optimization)
- A good cup of coffee ‚òï

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Aurora_Gold

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or if you prefer pnpm
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
**IMPORTANT**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory (same level as package.json):

```env
# Database Configuration (REQUIRED)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/aurora_gold

# Authentication (CRITICAL - REQUIRED)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=365d

# Google Gemini AI Configuration (REQUIRED)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# App Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001

# Payment Gateway - Razorpay Integration (REQUIRED for payments)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret_here

# Frontend Razorpay Configuration (REQUIRED for payments)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
```

### 3. Database Setup
Aurora Gold uses MongoDB for data storage. The application will automatically create the necessary collections on first run:
- `users` - User accounts and preferences
- `orders` - Gold purchase transactions
- `chats` - AI conversation history

### 4. Payment Gateway Setup (Razorpay)

To enable real payment processing, you need to configure Razorpay:

1. **Create Razorpay Account**
   - Visit [https://dashboard.razorpay.com/](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Complete the verification process

2. **Get API Keys**
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Generate API keys for Test Mode
   - Copy the Key ID and Secret

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```env
   # Backend Razorpay configuration
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
   RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret_here
   
   # Frontend configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
   ```

4. **Test Mode vs Live Mode**
   - Use `rzp_test_` prefixed keys for development
   - Switch to `rzp_live_` keys for production
   - Demo mode activates automatically if Razorpay isn't configured

### 5. Launch the Application
```bash
# Start the backend server
npm run server
# or
node server/index.js

# In a new terminal, start the frontend
npm run dev
# or
next dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and watch Aurora Gold come to life! üéâ

**Payment Testing**: If Razorpay credentials aren't configured, the app automatically uses demo mode with simulated successful payments.
